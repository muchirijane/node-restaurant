## Description

This is an amazing website that I made to practice simple node skills. I was able to use different modules like http, file system and url to navigate from one page to another. I got to use json file to store data and render it to the front-end that displays different recipes and cooking guidelines. For the first time I created my own module file and exported it to the main Javascript file to fill up details in the html template folder.\

It was a good way to learn some of the basics on how to create a simple API without any framework.

Ps: Because it uses node for the backend, the github link won't work. You will have to use a termial to view the site.
